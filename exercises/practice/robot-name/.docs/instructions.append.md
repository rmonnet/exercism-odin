## Odin-specific instructions

To solve this exercise, you will need to keep track of the names of the robots you created.
The `Robot_Storage` data structure is provided for this purpose.

Since robot names are `string` in Odin and will have to be manually allocated as you create the robots, it is your responsibility to reclaim the associated memory in the `delete_storage()` procedure.
